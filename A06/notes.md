Hash Table

Hash Map

Hash is like a function

keys - hash function - mod it by a number - buckets

hash collision - hash generates the same for two different buckets

Also store key in the bucket for confirmation

If hash collision, just put bucket after calculated value. (Linear Probing)

Open Addressing 
- Linear Probing
- Quadradic Programming (no benefit according to Seward)
- Double Hashing

Chaining
- Linked list at each bucket

Incremental Resizing

hashed table with incremental resizing and benchmarking.

- hash table with and without incremental resizing
- benchmark against built-in hash table
- make graphs
- portfolio piece writeup
- spoiler: incremental resizing is lame
- optional: look at memory usage
- other benchmarking
