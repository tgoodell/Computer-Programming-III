# CompSci is all about searching
# Linear search
# List comprehension
# Sequential Searching - O(n) - Every term must be passed
# Binary Searching (Ordered/Sorted list) - O(log(n)) - Divide and Conquer
# O(1) - One pass
# Regex! - import re

# Assignment: Pickl it in and out

# 2^?=n
# ?=log(n)

# BFS: Breadth-first Search - Long, but allows you to find fastest way.
# DFS: Depth-first Search (Recursive Back-tracking) - only know that you found the goal, not that it is the fastest.
    # Modification: cannot visit square you have already visited.
