now, this is a story all about how
my life got flipped-turned upside down
and i'd like to take a minute
just sit right there
i'll tell you how i became the prince of a town called bel air

in west philadelphia born and raised
on the playground was where i spent most of my days
chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
and all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
when a couple of guys who were up to no good
started making trouble in my neighborhood
i got in one little fight and my mom got scared
she said 'you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in bel air'

i begged and pleaded with her day after day
but she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
she gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
i put my walkman on and said, 'i might as well kick it'.

first class, yo this is bad
drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
is this what the people of bel-air living like?
hmm this might be alright.

but wait i hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
i don't think so
i'll see when i get there
i hope they're prepared for the prince of bel-air

well, the plane landed and when i came out
there was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
i ain't trying to get arrested yet
i just got here
i sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

i whistled for a cab and when it came near
the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
if anything i could say that this cab was rare
but i thought 'nah, forget it' - 'yo, homes to bel air'

i pulled up to the house about seven or eight
and i yelled to the cabbie 'yo homes smell ya later'
i looked at my kingdom
i was finally there
to sit on my throne as the prince of bel air
